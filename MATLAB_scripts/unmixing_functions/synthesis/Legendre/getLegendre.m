% Computes the Legendre polynomies method. The resulting matrix is computed by:
% theta1*legendre(k1,rank)'*theta2*legendre(k2,rank) where rank is
% an acumulative distribution from (0,1) along a vector of npoints.
%
% Input:
%   - npoints: spatial dimensions of the images, the images have the same
%   width and height.
%   - k1,k2: degrees of the Lengendre polinomies.
%   - theta1,theta2: weights for each Legendre polynomy
%
% Output:
%   - P: a 3-dimensional matrix (width x height x ne).

%% Legendre
rank = ((1:npoints)-1)/(npoints-1);

p1 = legendre(k1,rank);
p1 = (p1(1,:));

p2 = legendre(k2,rank);
p2 = (p2(1,:));

P = ((theta1*p1')*(theta2*p2));
