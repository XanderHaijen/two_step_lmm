% Return an hyperspectral synthetic image using a prebuild abundancies sample.
%
% Input:
%   - endmembers: the set of endmembers to use. The endmembers set must be
%   an e rows x p columns matrix, being 'e' the number of endmembers and 'p' the
%   number of bands of each endmember.
%   - abundancies: a sample of abundancies images. The abundancies must be
%   an w x h x n sized matrix, being 'w' and 'h' the width and height of
%   the spatial dimensions of the images, and 'n' the number of images in the sample.
%   'n' has to be equal to the number of endmembers 'e'.
%
% Output:
%   - syntheticImage: a 3-dimensional matrix (w x h x p) representing the built synthetic hyperspectral image.
